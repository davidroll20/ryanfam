      <h1>Welcome to the Ryan Fam website!</h1>
      <p>
        If you're a family member, this is a place to help us keep up with each other. If you're
        <i>not</i> a family member, I'm afraid there's not much here for you. If you're family, read
        on!
        <br />
        <br />
        Once you sign in, you'll be able to find upcoming events on the Calendar tab, or you can
        head over to the Bulletin tab to see family news, recipes, and whatever else someone has
        thought to contribute! If you're interested in posting something to the Bulletin yourself,
        just press the big [+] button there to get started!
        <br />
        <br />
        Right now, the site is pretty simple - we've got the aforementioned Calendar and Bulletin.
        Yet to come are features like an Image Gallery and maybe a dedicated area for recipes, if
        there's interest. Is there another feature you'd like to see added or tweaked? Let me know!
        This site is made completely from scratch, so we are limited only by our creativity! If you
        know who I am, you can just hit me up, but if you'd like to send any requests or feedback to
        a dedicated place to help me out with organizing, you can email me at
        <a href="mailto:contact@ryan-fam.com">contact@ryan-fam.com</a>. :)
